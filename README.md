# Pizza Lover - web app

Written as part of the [E-Commerce App using Kotlin, PHP and Paypal](https://www.udemy.com/android-e-commerce-app-using-kotlin-php-and-paypal-api/learn/v4/overview) course.

Instead of following the PHP sections (which were targeted at beginners) I took the opportunity to develop a full API. This coincided with Google starting their Closed Alpha of App Engine 7.2. As the project has now gone into [Public Beta](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/php7/), I can release the code that was deployed to App Engine.

It wasn't finished or as polished as it would normally be, but the focus of the course was Kotlin, not PHP. Maybe one day I'll take it further...
